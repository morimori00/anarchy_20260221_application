## High Impact

### 1. Investment Priority Ranking Dashboard

Add a dedicated page showing a ranked table of all buildings sorted by anomaly score. Include columns for building name, campus, gross area, construction year, anomaly score per utility, and an overall investment priority score. Allow the user to adjust signal weightings (e.g., emphasize electricity over steam) with sliders and see the ranking update in real-time. This directly addresses the hackathon's "prioritization" requirement and would make the demo more compelling.

### 2. Building Comparison Mode

Allow the user to select 2-4 buildings and view their time series charts overlaid on the same axes. This enables peer comparison (e.g., "these two buildings are the same age and size, but one uses 40% more electricity"). Could be accessed from the map by shift-clicking multiple buildings.

### 3. Chatbot Context from Current Page

When the user is on a Building Detail page and opens the chatbot, automatically inject the current building's context into the conversation. The assistant would know which building the user is looking at and could proactively offer analysis: "I see you're looking at Building 311. Its electricity consumption has been 35% above predicted since mid-September. Want me to investigate possible causes?"

## Medium Impact

### 4. SHAP Value Visualization

For each building's anomaly, show which input features (weather, time of day, building characteristics) contributed most to the model's prediction. Display as a waterfall chart or bar chart of SHAP values. This addresses the hackathon's "explainability" requirement.

### 5. Anomaly Time Range Highlighting on Map

Instead of showing a single anomaly score per building, allow the user to select a time range on the map page (e.g., "show anomalies for September 15-20 only"). The markers would update to reflect anomaly scores for just that period. Useful for correlating anomalies with specific weather events.

### 6. Weather Correlation View

On the building detail page, add a secondary chart showing weather variables (temperature, humidity) plotted alongside energy consumption. Use dual Y-axes or a normalized overlay to help users visually correlate weather changes with consumption spikes.

### 7. Export and Report Generation

Add an "Export Report" button on the Building Detail page that generates a PDF or markdown summary including building metadata, anomaly scores, key charts, and a narrative summary generated by the LLM. Useful for sharing findings with stakeholders who will not interact with the app directly.

## Low Impact / Nice to Have

### 8. Notification / Alert System

Define anomaly thresholds and generate alerts when new data is uploaded that triggers an anomaly. Show a notification badge on the sidebar and a list of recent alerts. More relevant for a production system than a hackathon demo.

### 9. Building Photo Integration

If building images are available (e.g., from Google Street View API), show them on the Building Detail page for visual context. Helps users who are not familiar with building numbers.

### 10. Multi-Campus Support

The current design assumes a single campus (Columbus). The data includes `campusName` as a field. A campus filter dropdown on the map page would allow switching between campuses. The map would recenter to the selected campus.

### 11. Keyboard Shortcuts

Add keyboard shortcuts for power users: `1-4` to switch pages, `Ctrl+K` to open chatbot, `/` to focus the chat input, arrow keys to navigate building markers on the map.
